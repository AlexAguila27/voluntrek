# React Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing a React hydration error due to client-side attributes being added to the body tag by browser extensions (specifically Grammarly). The error message indicated a mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-side HTML:

```
data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.1098.0"
data-gr-ext-installed=""
```

These attributes are added by the Grammarly browser extension and cause React hydration errors because they exist in the client-side DOM but not in the server-rendered HTML.

## Solution

1. Added `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the body tag in `src/app/layout.js`
   - This tells React to ignore mismatches in attributes for this specific element
   - This is a recommended approach for elements that might be modified by browser extensions

2. Improved email notification feedback
   - Added success alerts for both approval and rejection email notifications
   - This ensures admins know when emails have been successfully sent

## Additional Information

Hydration errors can occur due to:
- Client/server differences in code execution (e.g., `typeof window !== 'undefined'`)
- Variable inputs like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`
- Date formatting in user's locale
- External data changes
- Invalid HTML tag nesting
- Browser extensions modifying the DOM
